/* Layout
Give your forms some structure—from inline to horizontal to custom grid implementations—with our form layout options. */

/* Forms 
Every group of form fields should reside in a <form> element. Bootstrap provides no default styling for the <form> element, but there are some powerful browser features that are provided by default.

New to browser forms? Consider reviewing the MDN form docs for an overview and complete list of available attributes.
<button>s within a <form> default to type="submit", so strive to be specific and always include a type.
Since Bootstrap applies display: block and width: 100% to almost all our form controls, forms will by default stack vertically. Additional classes can be used to vary this layout on a per-form basis. */
