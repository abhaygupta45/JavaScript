    <!-- poem -->

    <p>
        I met a traveller from an antique land, <br>
        who said-"two vast trunkless legs of stone"<br>
        stand in desert. . . . Near Them, on the sand,<br>

        Half sunk a shattered visage lies, whose frown, <br>
        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, <br>

        Tell that its sculptor well those passions read <br>
        And on the pedestal, these words appear: <br>
        My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings; <br>

        Look on mhy works, ye Mighty, and despair! <br>
        Nothing beside remains. Round the decay <br>
         
        Of that colossal Wreck, boundless and bare <br>
        The lone and level sands stretch far away. <br>
    </p>
